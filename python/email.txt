Hi, Prof .Tang,

I'm Minkai. Really sorry to disturb you again and again... But, could I possibly know whether I'm accepted or not?
I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision, but I konw you're very busy recently so I'm just writing in case you may miss the response.

Really sorry for my frequent email, but hope you can undersand me. I have been worried a lot about the opportunity in your group for the past several weeks.
Looking forward to your early reply~

Minkai
